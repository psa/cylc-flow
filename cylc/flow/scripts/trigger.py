"""cylc trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Force task(s) to run regardless of prerequisites, even in a paused workflow.

Triggering a task that is not yet queued will queue it.

Triggering a queued task runs it immediately.

Cylc queues restrict the number of jobs that can be active (submitted or
running) at once. They release tasks to run when their active task count
drops below the queue limit.

Attempts to trigger active (preparing, submitted, running)
tasks will be ignored.

Examples:
  # trigger task foo in cycle 1234 in test
  $ cylc trigger test//1234/foo

  # trigger all failed tasks in test
  $ cylc trigger 'test//*:failed'

  # start a new flow by triggering 1234/foo in test
  $ cylc trigger --flow=new test//1234/foo

Flows:
  Waiting tasks in the active window (n=0) already belong to a flow.
  * by default, if triggered, they run in the same flow
  * or with --flow=all, they are assigned all active flows
  * or with --flow=INT or --flow=new, the original and new flows are merged
  * (--flow=none is ignored for active tasks)

  Inactive tasks (n>0) do not already belong to a flow.
  * by default they are assigned all active flows
  * otherwise, they are assigned the --flow value

  Note --flow=new increments the global flow counter with each use. If it
  takes multiple commands to start a new flow use the actual flow number
  after the first command (you can read it from the scheduler log).
